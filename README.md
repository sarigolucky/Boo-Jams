# Boo Jams

Version Alpha

Every Saturday night at 3 AM, in an abandoned theater, rogue ghosts convene to JAM OUT!

**Boo Jams** is a sandbox singing ghost game where players can create their own hauntingly melodic choir with unique vocals (And a ghost DJ!)

I created this game for my first game jam.
As you can see, it is a major work in progress. I am working to expand this into a game available for public release with the following features:

- Levels with objectives
- Increased variety (and quality) of ghost sounds (I want a bossa nova ghost!)
- Complete UI (Menus, help, settings)
